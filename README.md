# Surf-Composites-Starbucks-Research

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the research and development of optimizing surfboard designs. The primary focus is on understanding the intricacies of surfboard failure modes and exploring innovative design strategies to enhance surfboard durability and performance. The project also emphasizes the data collection process, which plays a pivotal role in informing design decisions.

## Purpose
The main objective of this project is to modify the failure mode of surfboards to better utilize the strength of the outer plates. By introducing innovative concepts, we aim to enhance the durability of surfboards without compromising their performance. This ensures that the boards remain comparable to high-performance shortboards in weight and functionality.

## Funding and Resource Allocation
The funds for this project were primarily utilized to gather essential materials for the construction of the test specimens. This includes:
- Foam
- Epoxy
- Fiberglass
- Carbon fiber
- Release film
- Breather
- Balsa wood
- Aluminum honeycomb

Additionally, a portion of the funds was allocated for living expenses during the summer research period.

## Time Commitment
Throughout the project, approximately 36-40 hours per week were dedicated to research, design, and testing. Preliminary work during the spring quarter was also crucial, which involved logistical preparations such as securing workspace, bulk ordering of materials, constructing the testing rig, and familiarizing with available equipment. The total research hours for the summer amounted to over 360 hours.

## Reference Manuals
This repository also contains reference manuals of various ASTM standards that were instrumental in guiding the research process.

## Contributions
This project was a collaborative effort. While Sascha focused on the preliminary work, the experimentation process was primarily overseen by the repository owner. Both contributors brought unique perspectives and expertise to the table, ensuring a holistic approach to the research.

## Mentorship
Our mentor, while hands-off, provided invaluable guidance, especially in the realms of design and testing processes. His expertise was sought when needed, but the research remained independent, allowing for autonomy and innovation.

## Feedback and Contributions
We welcome feedback and contributions from the community. If you have suggestions, insights, or would like to be a part of this research, please raise an issue or submit a pull request.
