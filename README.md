# Surfboard Optimization and Data Collection Project

## How to Use
To run the program, navigate to `Code/Notebooks/working.ipynb`. This will execute the various classes designed to track the Moment of Inertia, Weight, Expected failure load, shear and moment diagrams, t-test, and other measurements. The primary output is `specimens_df`, which can be generated using `build_specimens_output(specimens_fp)`.

## Overview
This repository focuses on the optimization of surfboard designs. By exploring surfboard failure modes and innovative design strategies, the aim is to enhance surfboard durability without compromising performance. The project also emphasizes data collection, which is crucial for informing design decisions.

Materials such as foam, epoxy, fiberglass, and carbon fiber were used in the construction of test specimens. The research involved a commitment of over 360 hours during the summer, with preliminary work in the spring quarter being pivotal. Reference manuals of various ASTM standards are also included in this repository.

Collaboration and mentorship played a significant role in the project's success. Feedback and contributions from the community are highly encouraged.
