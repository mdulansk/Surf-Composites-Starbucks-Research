Subject: Request for Material or Fiscal Donation for Surfboard Optimization Research Project - UC San Diego

Dear [COMPANY],

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Matt Dulansky, and I am a Structural Engineering and Data Science student at the University of California, San Diego. 
I am reaching out to you today on behalf of a research project that I am conducting with Sascha Stevens, my good friend and fellow Structural Engineering major. 
We are utilizing the iterative design process, combined with data science and machine learning techniques, to optimize the characteristics of surfboard design.
Our research focuses on understanding the dynamic behavior of surfboards and developing more resilient and durable surfboard designs capable of withstanding the 
forces produced by waves. In order to achieve our goals, we are seeking material donations to support our project. We believe that your company, with its expertise 
in [MATERIALS], would be a valuable partner in our endeavor.

These materials are essential for designing and testing a wide range of surfboard prototypes and iterations as we seek to enhance our understanding of surfboard dynamics and performance.
In return for your generous support, we would be delighted to showcase your company's contribution to our research. We can provide regular updates on our progress, share the results of our experiments, and acknowledge your company's support in any publications or presentations related to our project. Additionally, we can offer to include your company's logo and a brief description in our research proposal, which we have attached to this email for your reference.
To give you a visual insight into our work, we have also attached pictures of us building the test specimens and the setup we have created for testing. These images demonstrate the hands-on nature of our research and highlight the practical applications of the materials we are seeking.
Your contribution, whether in the form of material donations or fiscal support, would be invaluable to our project's success.
Thank you for considering our request. We would be grateful for any assistance you can provide. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. We eagerly look forward to the opportunity to discuss our research in more detail and explore potential collaboration.
Thank you for your time and attention.

Best regards,

Matt Dulansky
